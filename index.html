      <p class="intro">
        Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this
        website. My programming journey started back in 2021, just after
        completion of class 12th. I am currently a second year student pursuing
        BCA and learning stuffs Web Development and DSA. I like coding and
        fixing problems in code. I am in favour of learn by doing. Infact this
        website is also a small project to learn and practice HTML and CSS.
